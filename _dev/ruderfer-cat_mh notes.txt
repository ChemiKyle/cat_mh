There's basically 3 parts to this project
1 - have a thing that sends api request to cat-mh server when DR ruderfer wants (in survey? as project link?)
2 - have a thing that receives survey results from cat-mh server and stores on redcap
3 - poll cat-mh server occasionally to collect dropped results

cat-mh:
CAT is computer adaptive testing?
fun stuff about depression screener asking variable number of questions based on statistical stuff like variances to get a more helpful number that measures depression

1/25 skype call 11 am:
What is RDSD?
e-consent through REDCap
distribute survey
collect info
eventually have enough data to push to RDSD
he will send me credentials so I can start developing a module to get people taking tests
goal is to have it as broadly available (vumc-wide) as possible
eventually be collecting people who volunteer via MyResearch

Project ID: 71999

instructions:
install module on redcap server
configure system-level external module settings
	use the organizationid and applicationid provided by cat-mh API registration
configure project-level external module settings
	choose which CAT-MH tests to associate with which survey/instrument
	choose a field in the instrument to hold cat-mh results -- you should probably make this field hidden so it does not appear on the user survey


--------------------------_--------------------------_--------------------------_--------------------------_--------------------------

How the module works:
user ends survey ->
	redcap_survey_complete(args) hook called
module gets cat-mh config info via settings and sends user to ->

interview.php which calls ->
	cat_mh.createInterview(args)
then immediately ->
	cat_mh.authInterview(args)
then ->
	cat_mh.startInterview(args)
then ->
	cat_mh.getQuestion(args)

.. wait for user answer then
	cat_mh.submitAnswer(args) and immediately getQuestion(args)
	
finally
	cat_mh.getResults(args)
		put results in [catmh_results_field]

then cat_mh.endInterview(args)?
check for more tests to administer?
