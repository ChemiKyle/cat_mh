There's basically 3 parts to this project
1 - have a thing that sends api request to cat-mh server when DR ruderfer wants (in survey? as project link?)
2 - have a thing that receives survey results from cat-mh server and stores on redcap
3 - poll cat-mh server occasionally to collect dropped results

cat-mh:
